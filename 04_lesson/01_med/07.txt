class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.light_information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end

end

Make sure not to make redundant method names:

Light.light_information

That doesn't read quite right.  Instead, rename method to self.information. Then you could call it with:

Light.information
