Benefits of OOP in Ruby

ONE
Allows you to accurately model a solution to a problem using objects and interfaces as we think about things in real life.

TWO
Flexibility in code

THREE
Security in code in terms of only allowing objects to modify their own states, etc...

FOUR
Modular design elements would allow for easy cut and pasting and reuse of object ideas in a variety of programs

FIVE
Easier maintenance of code with easier to understand objects instead of large procedural nuances being messed with by a programmer new to a specific program or project's code
